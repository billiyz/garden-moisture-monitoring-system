# garden-moisture-monitoring-system
this project was handled by my DIDS_G group."measuring soil moisture using F411RE and Thingspeak Server"//https://github.com/DekutIOTDataScience/moisture_system/blob/master/README.md
this system monitors the moisture level of the soil or body.this system uses moisture sensor, this prototype can be in irrigation schemes and green house advanced schemes since the data used is used in trainning and machine learning carried on it to make the system artificially intellignt for high yields and optimization of crop yields.measuring soil moisture using F411RE and Thingspeak Server
thank you.
